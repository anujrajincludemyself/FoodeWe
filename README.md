# 🍔 Foodewe — Full-Stack Food Ordering Platform

Foodewe is a modern **full-stack food delivery web application** built using the **MERN stack**.  
It allows users to browse food items, add them to a cart, place orders, and track their previous orders with secure authentication.

This project was designed to simulate a real-world food delivery system similar to **Swiggy** or **Zomato**, focusing on **scalability, performance, and user experience**.

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

2. JWT token is generated
3. Token is stored in **localStorage**
4. Protected routes use **JWT for authorization**

This ensures secure access to cart, orders, and user data.
